# website-placeholder

## About
The website-placeholder is a small, fast loading static website that you can use as a placeholder on your website. The placeholder is also fully responsive, meaning that even phone users can see it! See the project in use [here](http://charliebritton.github.io/website-placeholder).

The background image comes from the [Unsplash Website](https://unsplash.com/) and can be found on the website [here](https://unsplash.com/search/tools?photo=IClZBVw5W5A). Feel free to change this image when you download the project. This can be done by replacing the `background-image.jpg` file with another file named `background-image.jpg`.

The footer is completely removable by removing code between `<!-- Start here -->` and `<!-- End here -->`.

## Installation

To install this software, please see the instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/charliebritton/website-placeholder/wiki)

## Use Cases
This is ideal for use if you are building a website for your company and you don't want the domain to be parked by your host.

## Licensing
The project is licensed under the [Unlicense License](http://unlicense.org "Unlicense Website") which means you can do whatever you like with this website although obviously it would be nice if you credited me and didn't sell this website.
